# Distraction-Warning-System

> Every 13 seconds, a life-altering car accident occurs.
> Despite the hope placed on Autonomous driving, it remains in its early stages and currently is not the solution. 
> That's why I developed the Distraction Warning System.
> This groundbreaking program detects distractions in both autonomous and human-driven cars, significantly
> reducing accidents and resolving this critical issue.
